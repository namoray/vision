# Subnet 19 ðŸ‘€
Subnet 19 is decentralised inference of AI models. We call ourselves `Vision ðŸ‘€`. Bittensor has the vision of being the most powerful force in AI, powering the world through decentralisation. SN19 is all about fulfilling that `Vision` by getting decentralised AI into the hands of all.

We have a focus on inference, currently offering access to the best open source LLM's, Image generation models (including those trained on datasets from subnet 19), and other miscellaneous models such as embedding models. We've even home grown and open sourced our own workflows, such as avatar generation.

# Decentralisation
Nothing is more important than the `Vision` - we must be decentralised. We rely on no centralised API's - the miners' and validators' all run their own models. No single provider can bring us down.

## Decentralised miners
Miners all run open source models on any hardware they choose. They're incentivised by two things:
- Volume (amount of tokens, for example)
- Speed of requests (Measured in Tokens/s, for example)

They're incentivised over a range of tasks, independently of each other. Miners have the option of choosing which tasks they want to run, and the volume they want to run for each. The more volume they have, the more rewards they get!

## Decentralised Validators
Validators operate as decentralised access points to the network. In a one-click fashion, Validators can offer up their miner access to the world, with a clear path to monetisation. 

They check and score the miners through 'Checking servers' that they run themselves on their own hardware. No centralisation to be found here.

P.S. to start a vali and miner on the same machine, and to only talk to eachother, use external_ip 0.0.0.0
